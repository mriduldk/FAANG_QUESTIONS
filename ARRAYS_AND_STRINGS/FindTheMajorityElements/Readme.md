You have to given an array A of size N.
Find all the elements which appear more than floor(N/3) times in the given array.
Wait Wait!
There is a condition that you have to do your job in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

## Input Format
First line contains N ->No. of elements in the array
Second line has N integers denoting the elements of the array A ie A1,A2,A3…….AN.

## Constraints
1<=N<=10^7
0<=Ai<=10^9

## Output Format
Print a single line containing all the majority elements occurring more than floor(N/3) times.
If there is no majority element then just print "No Majority Elements".
